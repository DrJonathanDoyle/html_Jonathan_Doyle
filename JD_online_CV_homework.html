            About Me
        </h2>

        <p class="">
            I’m a freelance filmmaker, photographer, and drone pilot.
            I love to capture real adventure stories about real people,
            the kind we can all really connect with. I have worked
            with brands such as Adidas Terrex, Montane, Paramo, BMC,
            Global Cycling Network, and Berghaus.
            There is nothing I love more than flying my drone, shooting
            from a rope or chasing after athletes to capture engaging
            and authentic imagery. Once more I strive to shoot and
            create meaningful content both for both my documentary
            and commercial work that will have a positive impact on
            the world around us.
            By documenting the real-life experiences of real
            people pushing their limits within the outdoors, I
            bring their stories to life through the exploration of
            their connections with health, friendships and the
            environment in which they thrive in. I believe the most
            powerful part of my craft is creating beautiful films with
            stories that everyone can relate to, perhaps helping
            them heal or begin to believe in their full potential.
            My debut adventure was selected for a number of film
            festivals across three continents and won first prize in the
            ‘One Year in Tas’ competition at Cradle Mountain Festival.

            <strong> Adidas Terrex - Camera assistant, drone pilot and video editor 2022 <br>
            Montane - Camera assistant 2022 </strong> <br>
            I have been a camera assistant for two Adidas shoots and one Montane shoot . This involved me looking after the
            photography and drone equipment for the duration of the shoots. I also had to look after the models, making sure
            they were well looked after and generally keeping their morale up, as well as ensuring that their outfits were well
            presented and always ready to capture. I also helped with the scene lighting, using a ref lector to enhance the scenes
            when needed. I was also asked to capture some drone footage for the f i rst Adidas Campaign.
            For the second Adidas Campaign [FW22 Terrex Freehiker 2] I worked on, I edited the video assets required by their
            marketing team. I only had four days to turn the project around and had to I follow a tight brief to ensure the creative
            style and energy matched their other assets. I used Frame. i o to maximise my efficiency for feedback and additional
            edits. In total I created 9 video assets both for the Terrex social media and marketing campaigns. <br><br>

            <strong> British Mountaineering Council - Camera operator and drone pilot - City Climb Series 2022 </strong> <br>
            I worked on all four episodes of the BMC’s City Climb series, capturing all of the B-roll, secondary interview angles,
            drone and climbing footage. We only had one day to film each episode, so the team had to work efficient ly together,
            making quick creative decisions to ensure we met the project brief, while capturing the highest quality content. <br><br>
            
            <strong> Albus Studios - Camera Operator and drone pilot - English Channel Swim Challenge 2022 </strong><br>
            I was part of a four person film crew following two teams of swimmers for several days as they attempted to swim
            across the English Channel. Large ocean swells for the duration of the challenge made the shooting conditions very
            difficult, however despite the severe seasickness, I was able to dig deep and keep shooting. <br><br>
            
            <strong> Trainee Grip 2021 </strong> <br>
            I worked as a trainee grip on three projects: A Japanese feature film, The Railway Children Return and the pilot
            episode for Noel Fielding’s new TV series. These jobs gave me great experience in working with much larger film
            crews, safely handling high-end equipment and also guiding the steady-cam operator over difficult terrain.

            <strong> Expedition - The Great Australian Triathlon - 2020 </strong> <br>
            After two years of planning, I embarked on a self-funded expedition with athlete Ben Cianchi to document his attempt
            to complete the first human-powered vertical crossing of Australia. For me this film was never about ego-boosting
            or earning bragging rights; it was about sharing a passion for combining exploration with creativity, telling a thought
            provoking story and to disrupt the flow of your standard adventure film.
            Due to the sheer size of the expedition, the filming predominantly followed the classic ‘run-and-gun’ style. It meant that
            I had to be constantly on the lookout for the best shots and then often only having moments to prepare for them. As a
            team-of-one I had to be strategic with my location selection to ensure I was in the right place at the right time to capture
            engaging and exciting footage. The expedition ran for 80 days, so it was imperative that my data-management was watertight,
            and as such I ensured two copies of the footage were saved at the end of each day, following a clear folder system. <br><br>

            <strong> Documentary - The Frozen Frog - 2021 </strong><br>
            The approach to shooting this film was entirely different to TGAT. I recruited a team of 10 people to cover every aspect of
            the documentary from additional camera operators and photographers, to a musical director and colour grader.
            The organisation of this project was paramount if it were to be a success, and as such I spent numerous days recceing
            the route and meticulously planning the shots needed to tell Ben’s story. I provided a thorough map of key locations,
            allocated specific tasks to the crew and even sourced a motorbike and canoe to film from. It was a mammoth day, 17
            hour non-stop shooting, but needless to say, we nailed it. <br><br>

            <strong> Short Film - Guardian - 2017 to present </strong><br>
            This has been a slow-burn project, following Matt Foot on his dry-tooling journey to climb some of the hardest routes
            in the UK. This project has really allowed me to hone in on the story-telling aspect of film-making; ensuring this project
            is not just about the climbing, but also about the athlete and how they are able to perform at such a high level despite
            having a full-time job and young family too. Furthermore, I have used this project to work on the project assets, creating
            a high-quality pitch-deck and accompanying promotional trailer. Through this work, I have managed to secure support
            from Petzl in the form of equipment and a small financial contribution. Matt and I were also invited to speak at the BMC
            Breakfast event at Kendal Mountain Festival, showing the trailer and securing an agreement to launch the film on BMC TV.
